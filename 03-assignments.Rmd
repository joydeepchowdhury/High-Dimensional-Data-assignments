1. Fix your roll number as the seed. Let $\Sigma$ be a $80 \times 80$ covariance matrix defined by $\sigma_{i j} = 0.6 + 0.6 \mathbb{I}(i = j)$. Let $X$ be a $80$ dimensional random vector with $X \sim N_{80}( 0, \Sigma )$. Denote the $i$th coordinate of $X$ as $X_i$, $i = 1, \ldots, 80$. Consider the following regression problem: $Y = (1 + X_1 + 2 X_2 - 3 X_3 - 4 X_4 + 5 X_5) + e$, where $e$ is an error variable independent of $X$. Generate a sample of size $30$ on $Y$ and $X$. Generate also a sample of size 5 from the distribution of $X$, and name the data matrix as $X_0$. Based on this sample,

    - Compute and plot the lasso solution paths.
    
    - Compute and visually present the outputs of the cross-validation process for the tuning parameter $\lambda$.
    
    - Print the value of $\lambda$ giving the minimum cross-validated error.
    
    - Print the value of $\lambda$ giving the most regularized model such that its cross-validated error is within one standard error of the minimum.
    
    - Print the estimated coefficients of the fitted lasso model for the value $\lambda$ being the one giving the minimum cross-validated error.
    
    - Print the estimated coefficients of the fitted lasso model for $\lambda = 0.5$.
    
    - Print the number of nonzero coefficients for the value $\lambda$ being the one giving the minimum cross-validated error.
    
    - Predict the response values at the covariate values in $X_0$ for $\lambda$ being the minimizer of the cross-validated error.

2. Based on the same data as above, solve all the above problems for the ridge regression method.

3. Again, based on the same data as above, solve all the above problems for the elastic net method, taking $\alpha = 0.5$.

4. Generate an independent sample of size $1000$ from the $Beta(1, 100)$ distribution, and assume that they are the p-values of $1000$ hypotheses tested simultaneously.

    - Compute the corresponding adjusted p-values for the Bonferroni correction, the Holm's method, the Hochberg's method, the Hommel's method, the Benjamini-Hochberg method and the Benjaminiâ€“Yekutieli method.
    
    - Compute the number of rejections in each case for the level being $0.05$.
